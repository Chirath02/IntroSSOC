I have used gdb and Medusa to reverse engineer the binary.
The first thing I found was the program applide md5 hashing to username.
Then the result which is 16bytes, is divided into two and the 2nd part is
xored and stored into the first part.

loop1:
  The index of an array of len 16 is calculated by shifting the md5 value by 0,
  16, 32 and 48 bits. The value at the array index is xored with rax.

Then rax is multiplied and added with two constants.This value is storred at
the top of the stack.

loop 2:
  7 64bit values are callulated by multiplying and adding with constants.
  These values are storred on the stack array.

md5 xored value is used as the 8th value in the stack array.

The key is storred from stack base pointer + 0x90
md5 xored value is added first.

loop3:
    calulates the rest of the key by xoring rsp and rsp+8 values.
    increament rsp till 7

The calulated key and commandline argument key is compared using strcmp.
